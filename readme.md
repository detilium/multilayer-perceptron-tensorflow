# Multilayer perceptron (MLP) using TensorFlow

The purpose of this project, is to create a multilayer perceptron 8MLP) neural network, using one of the most popular 
AI packages for Python; TensorFlow.

This project is heavily inspired by earlier project
[multilayer-perceptron-experiment](https://github.com/detilium/multilayer-perceptron-experiment).
